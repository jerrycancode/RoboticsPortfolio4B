# Mr Jeremiah Newlove's Robotics Portfolio
- Drive Train: 4 Motor standard,

- Launcher: Chain of 2 motor 2 working together to draw back a hammer attached to various strength -rubber bands. Once drawn back its released and launches the triballs forward.
  - Picker: A set of rollres put together with 1 motor or less used to sweep up triballs into the launcher. 

- Sweeper: Using a pnuematic piston added into the middle of the chassis to spread out its arms and push balls into the goal zone. 
    - Elevation Mechanism: Using a set of 3-4 pnuematic piston to raise a claw onto the pole, then the pnuematics retract and a new set of claws attach then the system repeats.
